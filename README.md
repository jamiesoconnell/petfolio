## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Passport.js, Cloudinary, Google OAuth, and more.

Petfolio was built with a wide range of technologies and tools. Here's a glimpse into how it all came together:

Frontend
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The frontend of Petfolio was crafted using fundamental web technologies to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS templates were used to dynamically generate HTML content, allowing for reusable components and easy data rendering.

Bootstrap: The Bootstrap framework was employed for responsive design and styling, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Backend
Node.js and Express.js: The backend server was built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust and efficient foundation for handling HTTP requests and responses.

MongoDB and Mongoose: Petfolio uses MongoDB as its database, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object-Document Mapping) for data modeling and interaction.

Authentication with Passport.js: Passport.js was integrated for user authentication, offering both local and Google OAuth strategies for user registration and login.

Cloudinary: Cloudinary's cloud-based media management platform was utilized for storing and serving user-uploaded pet images.

User Data and Sessions
Express Session and Connect-Mongo: User sessions were managed using Express Session and Connect-Mongo, allowing for secure and persistent user data storage.

## Lessons Learned:

Building Petfolio was a fantastic learning experience. Here are some key takeaways and insights gained during its development:

Full-Stack Development: Petfolio provided valuable hands-on experience with full-stack development, including frontend, backend, and database integration.

Authentication: Implementing user authentication with Passport.js and integrating Google OAuth expanded my understanding of user management.

Data Modeling: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose reinforced my data modeling and database interaction skills.

Third-Party APIs: Integrating third-party services like Cloudinary and Google OAuth taught me how to harness external resources to enhance an application's functionality.

Performance Optimization: Optimizing the application's performance and responsiveness demonstrated the importance of efficient code and resource management.

Error Handling: Effective error handling and debugging were crucial in delivering a stable and user-friendly application.

Continuous Learning: Petfolio reaffirmed the idea that software development is a continuous learning journey, with opportunities for growth in every project.
